ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Ronnel Rodriguez. I have industry experience in Web Development, currently specializing most in Front End Development, Search Engine Optimization, Digital Marketing and Event Registration Management.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing myself on enhancing and improving my JavaScript skills so I can proceed and start to have a deep dive in React JS soon.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m longing to become a full stack web developer in the future therefore once I get myself almost all set in Front End Development and I am pretty sure that it is going to take some time, I will go next to Back End Development.
